How to Fix It:
Go to Azure Portal:

Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations

Select your app: cb7ab876-1379-42f7-b731-d97b299374ad

Upload the New Certificate:

Go to Certificates & secrets

Under the Certificates tab, click Upload certificate

Upload the new .cer (X.509 public key) file used by your app

Verify Certificate Thumbprint:

Make sure the certificate thumbprint in your local code matches the one uploaded to Azure AD

Optional â€“ Double Check Code:
Ensure your app is referencing the correct certificate from the local certificate store or key vault. You may be still referencing an old one or a certificate from a different location.
